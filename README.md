A Desktop based flappy bird game and computer plays it automatically.
Just made to apply AI algorithms so watch it play..

there's nothing in the main repository. Look for its branches instead.
I have created different branches for different OS.
You can import the files or download the zip file and extract it on your desktop. 
Open and search for the FlappyBird.exe file in the folder and run the game.
